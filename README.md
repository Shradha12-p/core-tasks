# core-tasks

ðŸ”¹ Objective:

The objective of this assignment is to implement real-world logic in Python using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as custom classes, inheritance, access modifiers, file handling, and exception-safe coding.


âœ… Task Descriptions

1. Create Custom Classes

In this task, I designed a real-world class Book to represent a book object. It includes:

An __init__() constructor to initialize attributes like title, author, and pages.

A method display_info() to neatly display book information.


> ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcome:
I understood how to structure a Python class and use self, constructors, and methods effectively.




2. Inheritance & Access Modifiers

I created a Vehicle Management System using:

Inheritance (Car class inherits from Vehicle)

Access Modifiers:

_protected for brand

__private for model



> ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcome:
I learned how inheritance works in Python and how to use public, _protected, and __private data members for better encapsulation.




3. File-Based Data Storage

Built a User Feedback Collector that:

Takes input from users via console

Saves structured feedback to a file (feedback.txt)

Reads and displays previously saved feedback


> ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcome:
I learned how to use file operations to read from and write to files, creating persistent storage.




4. Exception-Safe Code

Created a Safe Calculator that:

Handles invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values)

Handles division by zero gracefully

Uses try-except blocks to catch and display meaningful error messages


> ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcome:
I understood how to manage runtime errors using exception handling and ensure smooth program execution.
